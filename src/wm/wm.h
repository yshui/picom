///
/// The reason for this two step process is because we want to catch all windows ever
/// created on X server's side. It's not enough to just set up event masks and wait for
/// events. Because at the point in time we set up the event mask, some child windows
/// could have already been created. It would have been nice if there is a way to listen
/// for events on the whole window tree, for all present and future windows. But alas, the
/// X11 protocol is lacking in this area.
///
/// The best thing we can do is set up the event mask to catch all future events, and then
/// query the current state. But there are complications with this approach, too. Because
/// there is no way to atomically do these two things in one go, things could happen
/// between these two steps, for which we will receive events. Some of these are easy to
/// deal with, e.g. if a window is created, we will get an event for that, and later we
/// will see that window again in the query tree reply. These are easy to ignore. Some are
/// more complex. Because there could be some child windows we are not aware of. We could
/// get events for windows that we don't know about. We try our best to ignore those
/// events.
///
/// Another problem with this is, the usual way we send a request then process the reply
/// is synchronous. i.e. with `xcb_<request>_reply(xcb_<request>(...))`. As previously
/// mentioned, we might receive events before the reply. And in this case we would process
/// the reply _before_ any of those events! This might be benign, but it is difficult to
/// audit all the possible cases and events to make sure this always work. One example is,
/// imagine a window A is being imported, and another window B, which is already in the
/// tree got reparented to A. We would think B appeared in two places if we processed
/// query tree reply before the reparent event. For that, we introduce the concept of
/// "async requests". Replies to these requests are received and processed like other X
/// events. With that, we don't need to worry about the order of events and replies.
