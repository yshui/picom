NAME
----
picom-inspect - easily test your picom rules

SYNOPSIS
--------
*picom-inspect* [_OPTIONS_]

DESCRIPTION
-----------
*picom-inspect* matches your picom rules against a window of your choosing. It helps you test your rules, and shows you which ones of your rules (don't) work.

OPTIONS
-------
*picom-inspect* accepts all options that *picom* does. Naturally, most of those options will not be relevant.

These are some of the options you might find useful (See *picom*(1) for descriptions of what they do):

*--config*, *--log-level*, *--log-file*, all the options related to rules.

*picom-inspect* also accepts some extra options: :::

  *--monitor*:: Keep *picom-inspect* running in a loop, and dump information every time something changed about a window.

NOTES
-----
*picom-inspect* is prototype right now. If you find any bug, for example, if rules are matched differently compared to *picom*, please submit bug reports to:
